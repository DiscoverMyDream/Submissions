DiscoverMyDream
The transition from 12th to college is a big step in any person’s life. During the stressful days between the results and available universities/colleges, DiscoverMyDream helps in accommodating the immense pressure and stress during these days to help people predict the outcome that they’ll probably face.
DiscoverMyDream provides a simple basic UI for a student in order to make the candidate comfortable in his/her personal choices.

Our application provides an easy access to all exams including GRE, SAT etc. 
The features are intricately designed to accomodate various technologies. The application provides for the likelihood of acceptance in universities using neural networks as well as a chat bot (most probably). It also provides for rank predictions in IIT-JEE and NEET along with a conversion tool of Asian (mostly Indian Institutions) 10 point CGPA to American 4 point GPA.
